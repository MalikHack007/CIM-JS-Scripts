Add another input option called "another priority date? "(yes or no radio button input)after "priority date is current". And, after Priority Date, add isInsideUS(radio button input yes or no) Now, by default, ONLY isCaseSpecific, hasPaid, isPp, and isFurtherInquiry will be visible initially. For User's Case, it'll appear after isCaseSpecific if 'yes' is selected for it. Otherwise, it will also appear after isPp if "yes" is selected for isPp. For remainingAttorneyFee, it'll ONLY appear if "no" is selected for hasPaid. For country of birth, priority date is current, isInsideUS, service center, processing time, and "another priority date?", they will ONLY appear if isPp is yes and case type is EB1A. For priority date, it will ONLY appear when "yes" is selected for "another priority date?". For h1bExpiring, it will ONLY appear when yes is selected for isInsideUS. 

you got it ALMOST RIGHT. Except I want the User's Case to move to right after isPp IF isCaseSpecific is selected as no and isPp is selected as yes. The logic for usersCase is that it will stay visible right after isCaseSpecific if it is selected yes for. BUT if it is a no, usersCase will move to AFTER isPp. Once is Pp is selected YES, usersCase will appear visible there.
